## C-Game
AQA Computer Science ALevel game
Grade: A*, 93%

_This game was created for my ALevel Computer Science coursework, where I was asked to come up with a problem to solve or investigate that interests me. I chose to create a game to help students revise as I felt (as a tutor) written tests were not encouraging as much active participation as I wanted. The game is text-based and has music, dialogue and ASCII art to make it entertaining whilst still asking students questions that either a teacher or the students themselves could upload/write. This project also demonstrated my skills in project documentation, and I have uploaded my writeup to show my implementation of the software development lifecycle._
