7,Welcome to area 3! You have somehow teleported to a video game world.
up7,You see an endless stream of binary code surrounding the whole area above you for what seems to be an infinite length.
right7,There seems to be a luminescent green rectangle. You assume it's a door to the next room.
down7,The floor is covered in binary code too. You attempt to read some, however can't read past 0.
left7,You see directions written on the wall. They say: Up, binary. Down, binary. Left, binary. Right, Pac-man.
8,You walked through the rectangle and somehow appeared in a new room. 
up8,The area above you was still filled with binary. 
left8,The rectangle on the left seemed to just be a door back to the other room. Filled with binary.
down8,Maybe if you repeat the numbers out loud you'll be able to read the binary. 0101000101001010100101010101001010101010010101010101001010101010100101010010101001010100000000010101010010101010100101010100101001010101010101001. Nevermind.
right8,The door to the right has writing above it. 'Pac-man. Do not enter' it reads. You decide you are going to enter.
9,Pac-man music blasts through the room. You take a second to dance before doing anything else.
up9,You see little Pac-man circles. You stand on your tiptoes to try and reach it but unfortunately your mouth is not big enough to eat it.
left9,The door back to the other room has scratches on it. You wonder how they got there.
down9,Looking down, you realise you were standing on Pac-man. Oops.
right9,010101001010101100101010100010100101110, the wall reads.
